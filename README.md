# PrediLnc
PrediLnc, a standalone software which used to predict top lncRNA associations if we provide any disease and its information as input and top disease associations if we provide any lncRNA and its information as input.

# Abstract
Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged to play diverse roles in gene regulation, cellular processes, and chromatin organization. Understanding lncRNA disease association is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic targets and deciphering the potential roles of lncRNAs in disease mechanisms. Our study developed a comprehensive platform named PrediLnc to disseminate and showcase the predictive outcomes generated by the model LDAPGAS, which stands for lncRNA Disease Association Predictor, using Graph convolutional network, Attention mechanism, and Stack Ensemble. It extracts lncRNA sequence information and disease ontology information to give prediction results. It also incorporates gene level, miRNA level, and protein level associative information. The architecture of LDAPGAS involves autoencoders for low-dimensional representation of features, graph convolutional networks and self-attention mechanisms for extracting node information, and the stack ensemble model for prediction. The Stack Ensemble includes Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Multi-Level Perceptron as five base models and a Random Forest Classifier as a meta-model. Apart from achieving exceptional results over stratified cross-fold validation, 10 case studies for different lncRNAs and disorders with over 500 PubMed research studies as evidence supporting these correlations are presented.
